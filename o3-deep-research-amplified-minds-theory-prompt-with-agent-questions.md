Please create coherent theory that is constructed in scientific principles
structured way, with clear path of consequences, conclusions and evidence
that is used in theories and clear cut between what is observed in the
studies and known, what are the theories and what are our hypothesis
so we can differentiate in this flow how we move towards our final
like model. So let me start with my personal few thoughts and later
the transcript from the YouTuber so you can construct from it a good
theory. So I was personally diagnosed with dyslexia as a kid but on
that time the diagnostics was very lacking so God knows if it's just
dyslexia. But what I learned across the years was that there are studies
and you can try to find them that took brains of dyslexic people when
they read and they diagnosed that on average they consume multiple times
if I recall correctly between 5 and 15 times more metabolic energy
when reading and this resonates with me and my personal experience
and also as I have a lot of autistic people in my life how we process
information and also highly sensitive people and also introverts. When
it comes about introverts I heard about another theory that we have
amount of like this white matter, grey matter etc. and basically that
in introvert people it's different and that explanation could be that
for each incoming amount of external stimuli introverts have way more
internal processing triggered than extroverts therefore extroverts need
way more external stimuli etc. to achieve the same level of arousal
internally comparing to introverts and all those neurotypes kind of
resonate those topics with what was in the transcript to me and probably
it's good to also try to look at the whole thing beyond just labels if
it's like dyslexic, autistic, neurodiversity of highly sensitive people
or any other kind and try to extract some trace features that can be
combination of physiological like as I said brain wiring, amount of
wires on different levels of the brain processing and grey white matter
etc. also wiring between left and right hemisphere that's also something
to consider and and type of modalities because visual thinking, sensory,
kinesthetic thinkers may process in parallel way more than people in
internal monologue and linearizing, verbalizing stuff especially with
synesthesia like spatial numbers, ideasthesia, synesthesia representations
and have way way faster processing that way additionally I would combine
all of this and my personal theory is that apart from this aspect that
I said of internal processing and a lot of that said that what is going
on is that those brains act a little bit more like amplifier of what is
coming inside and they can do a lot of more I like a lot and resonates
with experience what the person said in the transcripts about that
one piece of information can trigger a flood of pictures, memories and
conclusions and parallel very very intense condensed experience of in
the split second processing millions of connections and rewiring them
in parallel because of this new piece of information and later being
drained but in the same time adopting super fast and to me my personal
theory why the adoption to new situations etc. is breaking and they
may be known that they are bad by marginally eliciting people is that I
believe that it may be a confusion arising from the fact that there are
different thresholds when the brain just is being confused because every
brain will be confused if it will get too much uncorrelated pattern less
noise and basically maybe just problem of the signal to noise and people
in my surroundings for example like to say that I'm very very good in
extrapolating and learning from very small amount of very high quality
information and that's why for example looking at the representations of
the graphs (in general graphs are amazing abrstraction, knowledge graphs,
ontologies, graph algorithms for my brain as in daily life conversation
everything connects, mathematics, physics, cognitive sciense, theory with
practice when theory is being embodied, billogy, sociology, psychology,
spirituality, mathematics, cognitive sciense, etc...) is something that
I can do very efficiently and discrete graphs normal people asses that
they can on average look comprehend 5, 10, max 50 vertices connected
and I was working a lot in scientific analysis with like hundreds or
thousands of vertices just looking at them and making sense out of them
if algorithms work correctly and most brains just see noise in this at
the same time it costs differently in my brain so let me now provide you
a transcript of the guy and please look for all the science that we know
cognitive science our understanding of the mental processes especially
now with the rise of like AI and creating like models of cognition and
artificial cognition combine all the theories together and create one new
clearly laid out structured inference and highlighting which things come
from the evidence which come from established agreed theories and which
come from hypothesis and which are our hypothesis models conclusions and
those that you want so will arrive to conclude some coherent theory that
will help also with the with what basically with what the author of the
transcript below the youtuber tried to communicate

If you're autistic and you relate to most of the contemporary definitions
or understandings of what autism is, but there's something about the way
people talk about it, maybe even the diagnostic criteria that is just,
it's not quite exactly right, I want to tell you about the Intense
World Theory.

If you have identified with any of my videos "I think I figured out
autism," what I hope that this is as validating for you as it has been
for me, because I have been talking about this for a couple of years
now and I didn't even know that it had a name until recently. It's a
bandwidth thing.

This is one that I want to be really careful with, so I want to remind
people that I am not a doctor, I'm not a professional, nor is what I'm
about to talk about the generally accepted understanding of what autism
is. It's a theory, a theory that has been getting some traction lately
amongst lower support needs circles. I myself also have ADHD and I think
it's really important that people find the language to be able to describe
their experiences, but I also think it's really important for people to
understand where I am coming from, and I don't want people to think that I
am trying to say that this is the experience of everyone who is autistic.

Most of the generally accepted understandings of what autism have been
over the years is that it is a deficit, that we are lacking something or
we have an impairment with our brains that prevents us from processing
information like allistics, which is an understandable thing to think from
an outside observer because we struggle with a lot of different things. We
struggle with body language, social skills, ambiguity. Sometimes we
get so overwhelmed that we start to shut down, we lose the ability to
verbalize things. But that has never felt like an accurate description of
my experience. Again, I can understand why people would think that from
the outside, and I certainly have some very big life-altering impairments
that come with my autism, but it's never felt like I am missing something.

The Intense World Theory basically says that the reason it looks like
we are missing something is actually because we have too much. We have a
surplus, we have an excess of information processing. Your mind takes in
a very large amount of stimulus and information that you're very aware
of. We experience emotions and stimulus more intensely. We even have
increased neuroplasticity.

What happens is that all that stimulus, that information, it gets
to a point where our brains can't keep up with it. We have too much
information coming in, not enough processing power to keep up with
it. It's a bandwidth thing. And because of that surplus of stimulus
and information, it can be hard to keep track of everything, how to
figure out what information is relevant and to hold on to and what's
irrelevant and to get rid of. And the more overstimulated we become,
the harder it is to think properly, which means it's even harder to
track that information, and eventually we hit a tipping point where it
just becomes a downward spiral.

And this is why unpredictability can be so overstimulating for us,
because for one, unpredictability just takes more processing power. It's
also harder to prepare ahead of time. When we're not in control, there
is a higher likelihood that we end up in a situation that is just enough
to push us into that downward spiral.

This is why things like social etiquette can be so confusing or hard on
us if it's something that we're not aware of, while also at times being
comforting if we are looking for things that are predictable. This is
why we like to self-regulate alone, why we like to do repetitive tasks
or we have specific comfort items, because we are looking to reduce the
stimulus and take care of our nervous system to give it a break.

The Intense World Theory also talks about autistic people having increased
levels of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is just your brain's ability
to rewire neural pathways, to retrain existing parts of itself to do
things that it wasn't responsible for before. What that looks like is
autistic people more quickly adapt to new information or experiences.

But that doesn't make sense, right? Because autistic people are supposed
to be rigid thinkers, which I've already talked about. Adaptability
in this sense doesn't mean that we are spontaneous risk takers and
adventurers. We can be, but what it means for this is that we experience
new information and changes more intensely. Taking in new information can
be far more impactful on us, which is why new things often feel chaotic.

Maybe we find out about a new social rule that we were completely unaware
of, and it not only reshapes how we think about this specific situation,
but it has ripple effects. It starts to impact how we think about other
social situations as well. And this one piece of information starts
to become fairly intensive because it is reshaping how we think about
a whole bunch of different things, whereas someone whose brain doesn't
adapt as quickly might only make note of it for this specific situation
or might just dismiss it entirely.

The problem with this idea though is that it's not really something
that plays out right. I mean, autistic people aren't really known for
being good at inferring information or extrapolating information to
new situations. Some autistic people are good at it at different times,
but it's not really something that we're known for. And I think this is
where a lot of outside observers of autism run into the pitfall of not
doing a good job of understanding how the mechanics of autism play out
in the bigger picture of just basic human psychology.

I'm probably not qualified to be your therapist. Oh sure, yeah, no. We
also have these same basic human need to feel safe. We have an aversion
to danger. And just like anyone has a hard time with information that
makes them feel unsafe or contradicts their worldview, we also have a
tipping point with new information.

And when you combine the basic human need for some level of reliability or
stability mixed with what I was describing earlier, why autistic people
need predictability to calm their nervous system, you can understand how
new that we experience more intensely becomes that much more quickly
overwhelming, to the point that some of us just start avoiding new,
because new can be enough to send us into the downward spiral where our
brains just start shutting down. And from the outside, that looks like
we have a deficit.

And here I want to add a really quick anecdote from my life that I've
heard from other people in the autistic community, which is that I have
a very strong response to negative stimulus. This is one of the reasons,
as I get older, I have a shorter and shorter list of safe foods, because
all it takes is one bad experience with a food that I like to ruin the
food for me. That's all I can associate with it. Years ago I had spoiled
milk and it ruined dairy for me. I got food poisoning from a kiwi and
it ruined kiwis for me. And this also impacts other relationships and
situations. If I get hurt or have a negative experience, it's very hard
to not relate those two things together.

And if I zoom out a little, this is how I navigate pretty much
everything. I am very problem focused, and I don't mean that I'm
negative. I'm looking for problems and how to avoid them or prevent
them or how to fix them, which makes it really hard to just enjoy things
because I'm very focused on how to fix or prevent negative stimulus.

The Intense World Theory is basically describing a mismatch in cognitive
abilities. It's a bandwidth thing, which is already something that we
are looking for when evaluating adults for autism. We have an excess of
information coming in and not enough processing power to sift through
all of it.

And I think the natural question that people have is: how do we know that
it is an excess of information and it's not that you have a deficit or
a limitation with your processing power? And I don't know that I can
give you a good answer. I think if I could, this theory would have a
lot more traction.

So I'll wrap it up by explaining why this is a much more accurate
description of my experience. It is the millions of day-to-day little
indicators: recognizing changes in recipes from food companies that other
people don't pick up on, recognizing the variations in the manufacturing
process for my favorite drink because they have different levels of tonic
to syrup ratio, recognizing around 2020 toilet paper started smelling
like it was being recycled. It is explaining to someone that the flaps
that connect my nasal passageway to my throat feel weird today, or talking
about feeling my bones and people not understanding what that means.

It is all of the definitions or descriptions of autism that say that I am
not able to pick up on something or recognize something like social cues,
when in reality I do pick up on them. It's that I have other things going
on in my mind that prevent me from being able to process them correctly
or making me overthink them. It's all of the little things like that
that are telling me there's too much.

And maybe that's what this all boils down to. Maybe we do take in an
excess of information and we rewire our brains more efficiently. Or
maybe we're just more aware of certain stimulus, and when we take in
more information that we're aware of, we're more likely to then run that
through mental models which becomes overwhelming. Maybe some processes
are just better left running in the background.
