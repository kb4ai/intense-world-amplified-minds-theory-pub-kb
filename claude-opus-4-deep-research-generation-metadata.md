## Feedback from model about generation:

Your neurodivergent cognition report is ready. It explores the "selective amplification" theory, explaining how neurodivergent brains allocate energy differently, creating zones of hyperfunction. The report covers sensory processing differences, unique network topologies, embodied cognition, metabolic variations, and alternative information processing strategies. It reframes neurodivergence as an alternative cognitive architecture with distinct advantages rather than deficits, with implications for environment design, education, technology, and cultural evolution.
