Key Points
Research suggests autism, dyslexia, and highly sensitive persons (HSP) share traits of intense brain processing, but how they show up differs.
It seems likely that these conditions involve heightened sensitivity in specific areas like senses, emotions, or language, leading to both strengths and challenges.
The evidence leans toward a common thread of "hyper-processing," but more studies are needed to confirm overlaps and differences.
Personal experiences, like feeling drained after reading or processing complex information quickly, align with this idea, though they're not scientific proof.
Understanding Neurodiversity
Neurodiverse conditions like autism, dyslexia, and being a highly sensitive person (HSP) might share a common way of processing information more intensely than usual. This means their brains might react more strongly to things like sounds, emotions, or reading, which can be both a strength (like noticing details others miss) and a challenge (like feeling overwhelmed easily). For example, autism might mean feeling sensory inputs very intensely, dyslexia could mean struggling with reading due to high brain energy use, and HSPs might feel emotions deeply.
Personal Experiences and Theory
Your experience of using more energy when reading and processing information quickly fits with research on dyslexia and autism, suggesting your brain might work harder in certain tasks. The YouTuber's idea of autism as "too much information" also supports this, showing how intense processing can lead to both amazing insights and feeling drained. This theory helps see these conditions as part of a spectrum, not just separate labels.
Next Steps
While this theory makes sense with current research, it's still developing, and more studies are needed to see how these conditions connect. It’s a way to understand and value different brain styles, but we should keep exploring to support everyone better.
Survey Note: Detailed Exploration of the Neurodiversity Spectrum of Intensity
This survey note provides a comprehensive analysis of the query, integrating the Intense World Theory (IWT) of autism with personal experiences, the provided transcript, and established scientific knowledge from cognitive science. The goal is to construct a coherent theory that explains the overlap between autism, dyslexia, highly sensitive persons (HSP), and related neurodiverse conditions, emphasizing shared mechanisms of "hyper-processing" or intense world experiences. The response is structured to differentiate between observed evidence, established theories, hypotheses, and personal conclusions, aiming to mimic a professional scientific article.
Introduction
Neurodiversity encompasses a range of conditions, including autism, dyslexia, and highly sensitive person (HSP) traits, each characterized by unique cognitive and sensory processing profiles. The query highlights personal experiences of dyslexia, intense internal processing, and connections to autism and HSP, alongside a transcript discussing the Intense World Theory (IWT). This theory, proposed by Markram et al. (2010), suggests autism involves hyper-functioning of local neural microcircuits, leading to hyper-reactivity and hyper-plasticity. This survey note aims to synthesize these elements into a unified theory, the "Neurodiversity Spectrum of Intensity," which posits that these conditions represent different expressions of heightened brain processing, with shared and distinct manifestations.
Theoretical Framework
The proposed theory, the Neurodiversity Spectrum of Intensity, hypothesizes that neurodiverse conditions like autism, dyslexia, HSP, and potentially introversion, lie on a spectrum characterized by variations in "hyper-processing." This involves heightened sensitivity or reactivity in specific domains (sensory, cognitive, emotional), leading to both strengths and challenges.
Core Aspects of the Theory
The theory is built on the following components:
Hyper-Processing Spectrum: Conditions are seen as different profiles on a spectrum where the brain processes information with increased intensity. For instance:
Autism: Broad hyper-processing across sensory, cognitive, and emotional domains, leading to strengths like attention to detail and challenges like sensory overload.
Dyslexia: Specific hyper-processing in language-related areas, particularly during reading, resulting in higher metabolic demands and difficulties with phonological processing, but also strengths in visual or spatial thinking.
HSP: Heightened sensitivity to sensory and emotional stimuli, with increased activity in empathy and self-awareness regions, leading to greater awareness but potential for overwhelm.
Introversion: Greater internal processing of stimuli, preferring less stimulating environments for reflection.
Common Underlying Mechanisms: Research suggests shared brain mechanisms, including:
Increased neural connectivity or reactivity, as seen in autism's hyper-functional microcircuits (Markram et al., 2010).
Differences in neurotransmitter systems, such as dopamine and serotonin, affecting processing in HSPs and autism (Acevedo et al., 2014).
Enhanced synaptic plasticity, leading to faster learning but potential overwhelm, as noted in IWT and dyslexia studies (Shaywitz et al., 2003).
Structural variations, like grey and white matter differences, impacting information processing efficiency (Koyama et al., 2011).
Differences in Manifestation: While mechanisms overlap, manifestations differ based on affected domains:
Autism involves hyper-perception, hyper-attention, and hyper-emotionality, leading to a "supercharged" brain struggling with filtering (Markram et al., 2010).
Dyslexia shows specific deficits in phonological processing but strengths in visual-spatial tasks, with studies indicating altered brain metabolism during reading (Rumsey et al., 1994).
HSPs exhibit greater emotional reactivity and sensory sensitivity, with fMRI studies showing increased activation in empathy-related regions (Acevedo et al., 2014).
Integration with Cognitive Science
The theory aligns with cognitive science theories, such as:
Attention: Autism's weak central coherence theory suggests a bias towards local processing, while dyslexia's challenges involve integrating phonological information (Frith, 1989; Snowling, 2000).
Memory: Autism's hyper-memory (IWT) contrasts with dyslexia's working memory challenges, highlighting domain-specific differences.
Sensory Processing: Both HSPs and autistic individuals show heightened sensitivity, but autism may involve more global sensory overload, while HSPs focus on emotional and social stimuli (Aron et al., 2012).
Evidence Supporting the Theory
The theory is grounded in empirical evidence from various studies:
Autism (IWT): Markram et al. (2010) propose hyper-functioning of local neural microcircuits, supported by animal models like the valproic acid (VPA) rat, showing 50% increased connectivity and doubled long-term potentiation (LTP) . Human studies show hyper-reactivity in neocortex and amygdala, leading to hyper-perception and hyper-emotionality.
Dyslexia: Research indicates altered brain metabolism, with dyslexic adults showing higher metabolism in the medial temporal lobe during auditory tasks (Rumsey et al., 1994, Cerebral brain metabolism in adult dyslexic subjects assessed with positron emission tomography during performance of an auditory task). Studies also find lower total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA) in the occipital cortex, suggesting metabolic differences (Richlan et al., 2013, Dyslexia and age related effects in the neurometabolites concentration in the visual and temporo-parietal cortex).
HSP: fMRI studies show HSPs have stronger activation in regions like the insula and anterior cingulate cortex for empathy and awareness, with heightened activity in the ventral tegmental area for reward processing (Acevedo et al., 2014, The highly sensitive brain: an fMRI study of sensory processing sensitivity and response to others' emotions). This aligns with heightened sensitivity to social and emotional stimuli.
Overlaps and Comorbidities: Studies suggest overlaps, with autism and dyslexia sharing sensory processing difficulties and language challenges (Cross River Therapy, 2025, Autism and Dyslexia: Similarities & Differences). HSP is considered neurodivergent, with genetic and physiological differences in neurotransmitter processing (HSPJourney, 2023, Is There A Connection Between HSP And Neurodiversity?).
Personal Experiences and Anecdotal Evidence
The query includes personal experiences of being diagnosed with dyslexia, experiencing high metabolic energy consumption when reading, and intense internal processing, which resonate with the theory. The transcript from GenericArtDad What is the "Intense World Theory" #actuallyautistic #autismawareness #asdawareness #audhd describes autism as an "excess of information processing," aligning with IWT's hyper-reactivity. These anecdotes illustrate how hyper-processing can manifest as both strengths (e.g., rapid learning from high-quality information, processing complex graphs) and challenges (e.g., feeling drained, sensory overload).
Hypotheses and Future Directions
Several hypotheses emerge for further research:
The Neurodiversity Spectrum of Intensity could be quantified using biomarkers like brain metabolism, neural connectivity, or neurotransmitter profiles.
Different conditions might represent distinct "processing profiles," with varying degrees of hyper-processing in sensory, cognitive, or emotional domains.
Environmental factors, such as trauma, could modulate manifestations, as suggested by IWT's emphasis on emotionally charged experiences accelerating symptom progression.
Longitudinal studies and comparative analyses are needed to validate these hypotheses, particularly comparing brain processing across autism, dyslexia, HSP, and other conditions.

It accounts for personal experiences, like high metabolic energy during reading and intense internal processing, aligning with scientific findings. This framework offers a way to understand and value neurodiversity, emphasizing both challenges and strengths, while highlighting the need for further research to refine and validate the theory.
