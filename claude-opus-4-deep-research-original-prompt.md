Thanks for your rich and thoughtful input. To construct a scientifically grounded theory based on your personal experience and the "Intense World Theory" from the video, could you please clarify a few points so I can structure the theory rigorously:
1. What is the intended scope of the theory? For example, are you aiming to explain cognitive processing in all neurodivergent populations (dyslexics, autistics, introverts, HSPs) or specifically in autistic individuals with overlapping traits?
2. Do you want this theory to focus primarily on internal cognitive mechanisms (like bandwidth, sensory amplification, synesthesia), or also include social/behavioral manifestations?
3. Should the model include AI/cognitive science analogies or inspirations (e.g., bandwidth, signal-to-noise, memory models)?
4. Would you like the final theory structured as a scientific paper-style model (with sections like Observation, Theory, Hypothesis, Model, Conclusion)?
Once I have this clarification, Iâ€™ll synthesize all the scientific and theoretical evidence to build a coherent, well-structured model.

all to resonate with both authors experiences, thought, and going beyond labelling people into population labels, and with neurodiverse approach focus more on underlying mechanisms, cognitive processes, traits, cognitive structues, mechanisms, mental processes, types of thinking etc...
all is great
We like to use from all disciplines what will allow to convey maximum information in given words, therefore concepts, metaphores, annalogies, parallels from all disciplines including cognitive scienses, philosophy of mind, spirituality, mathematics, psychology, and more... assume polymath very diverse reader
format should focus on most efficient way of layout out for reader how all concepts connect with each other, focusing on artful combination of educational, scientific, and engaging writing, therefore go beyond any forms, and mix styles and sections as artistic scientific polymath genius to maximize inspiration, information, and insights thoughtput
