If you're autistic and you relate to most of the contemporary definitions or understandings of what autism is, but there's something about the way people talk about it, maybe even the diagnostic criteria that is just, it's not quite exactly right, I want to tell you about the Intense World Theory.

If you have identified with any of my videos "I think I figured out autism," what I hope that this is as validating for you as it has been for me, because I have been talking about this for a couple of years now and I didn't even know that it had a name until recently. It's a bandwidth thing.

This is one that I want to be really careful with, so I want to remind people that I am not a doctor, I'm not a professional, nor is what I'm about to talk about the generally accepted understanding of what autism is. It's a theory, a theory that has been getting some traction lately amongst lower support needs circles. I myself also have ADHD and I think it's really important that people find the language to be able to describe their experiences, but I also think it's really important for people to understand where I am coming from, and I don't want people to think that I am trying to say that this is the experience of everyone who is autistic.

Most of the generally accepted understandings of what autism have been over the years is that it is a deficit, that we are lacking something or we have an impairment with our brains that prevents us from processing information like allistics, which is an understandable thing to think from an outside observer because we struggle with a lot of different things. We struggle with body language, social skills, ambiguity. Sometimes we get so overwhelmed that we start to shut down, we lose the ability to verbalize things. But that has never felt like an accurate description of my experience. Again, I can understand why people would think that from the outside, and I certainly have some very big life-altering impairments that come with my autism, but it's never felt like I am missing something.

The Intense World Theory basically says that the reason it looks like we are missing something is actually because we have too much. We have a surplus, we have an excess of information processing. Your mind takes in a very large amount of stimulus and information that you're very aware of. We experience emotions and stimulus more intensely. We even have increased neuroplasticity.

What happens is that all that stimulus, that information, it gets to a point where our brains can't keep up with it. We have too much information coming in, not enough processing power to keep up with it. It's a bandwidth thing. And because of that surplus of stimulus and information, it can be hard to keep track of everything, how to figure out what information is relevant and to hold on to and what's irrelevant and to get rid of. And the more overstimulated we become, the harder it is to think properly, which means it's even harder to track that information, and eventually we hit a tipping point where it just becomes a downward spiral.

And this is why unpredictability can be so overstimulating for us, because for one, unpredictability just takes more processing power. It's also harder to prepare ahead of time. When we're not in control, there is a higher likelihood that we end up in a situation that is just enough to push us into that downward spiral.

This is why things like social etiquette can be so confusing or hard on us if it's something that we're not aware of, while also at times being comforting if we are looking for things that are predictable. This is why we like to self-regulate alone, why we like to do repetitive tasks or we have specific comfort items, because we are looking to reduce the stimulus and take care of our nervous system to give it a break.

The Intense World Theory also talks about autistic people having increased levels of neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is just your brain's ability to rewire neural pathways, to retrain existing parts of itself to do things that it wasn't responsible for before. What that looks like is autistic people more quickly adapt to new information or experiences.

But that doesn't make sense, right? Because autistic people are supposed to be rigid thinkers, which I've already talked about. Adaptability in this sense doesn't mean that we are spontaneous risk takers and adventurers. We can be, but what it means for this is that we experience new information and changes more intensely. Taking in new information can be far more impactful on us, which is why new things often feel chaotic.

Maybe we find out about a new social rule that we were completely unaware of, and it not only reshapes how we think about this specific situation, but it has ripple effects. It starts to impact how we think about other social situations as well. And this one piece of information starts to become fairly intensive because it is reshaping how we think about a whole bunch of different things, whereas someone whose brain doesn't adapt as quickly might only make note of it for this specific situation or might just dismiss it entirely.

The problem with this idea though is that it's not really something that plays out right. I mean, autistic people aren't really known for being good at inferring information or extrapolating information to new situations. Some autistic people are good at it at different times, but it's not really something that we're known for. And I think this is where a lot of outside observers of autism run into the pitfall of not doing a good job of understanding how the mechanics of autism play out in the bigger picture of just basic human psychology.

I'm probably not qualified to be your therapist. Oh sure, yeah, no. We also have these same basic human need to feel safe. We have an aversion to danger. And just like anyone has a hard time with information that makes them feel unsafe or contradicts their worldview, we also have a tipping point with new information.

And when you combine the basic human need for some level of reliability or stability mixed with what I was describing earlier, why autistic people need predictability to calm their nervous system, you can understand how new that we experience more intensely becomes that much more quickly overwhelming, to the point that some of us just start avoiding new, because new can be enough to send us into the downward spiral where our brains just start shutting down. And from the outside, that looks like we have a deficit.

And here I want to add a really quick anecdote from my life that I've heard from other people in the autistic community, which is that I have a very strong response to negative stimulus. This is one of the reasons, as I get older, I have a shorter and shorter list of safe foods, because all it takes is one bad experience with a food that I like to ruin the food for me. That's all I can associate with it. Years ago I had spoiled milk and it ruined dairy for me. I got food poisoning from a kiwi and it ruined kiwis for me. And this also impacts other relationships and situations. If I get hurt or have a negative experience, it's very hard to not relate those two things together.

And if I zoom out a little, this is how I navigate pretty much everything. I am very problem focused, and I don't mean that I'm negative. I'm looking for problems and how to avoid them or prevent them or how to fix them, which makes it really hard to just enjoy things because I'm very focused on how to fix or prevent negative stimulus.

The Intense World Theory is basically describing a mismatch in cognitive abilities. It's a bandwidth thing, which is already something that we are looking for when evaluating adults for autism. We have an excess of information coming in and not enough processing power to sift through all of it.

And I think the natural question that people have is: how do we know that it is an excess of information and it's not that you have a deficit or a limitation with your processing power? And I don't know that I can give you a good answer. I think if I could, this theory would have a lot more traction.

So I'll wrap it up by explaining why this is a much more accurate description of my experience. It is the millions of day-to-day little indicators: recognizing changes in recipes from food companies that other people don't pick up on, recognizing the variations in the manufacturing process for my favorite drink because they have different levels of tonic to syrup ratio, recognizing around 2020 toilet paper started smelling like it was being recycled. It is explaining to someone that the flaps that connect my nasal passageway to my throat feel weird today, or talking about feeling my bones and people not understanding what that means.

It is all of the definitions or descriptions of autism that say that I am not able to pick up on something or recognize something like social cues, when in reality I do pick up on them. It's that I have other things going on in my mind that prevent me from being able to process them correctly or making me overthink them. It's all of the little things like that that are telling me there's too much.

And maybe that's what this all boils down to. Maybe we do take in an excess of information and we rewire our brains more efficiently. Or maybe we're just more aware of certain stimulus, and when we take in more information that we're aware of, we're more likely to then run that through mental models which becomes overwhelming. Maybe some processes are just better left running in the background.
